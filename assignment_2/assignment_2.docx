1.
The two values of Boolean data type are 0 and 1, written as True and false

2.
AND, OR and NOT

3.

1 AND 1 = 1
0 AND 0 = 0
1 AND 0 = 0
0 AND 1 = 0

1 OR 1 = 1
0 OR 0 = 0
1 OR 0 = 1
0 OR 1 = 1

NOT 1 = 0
NOT 0 = 1

4.
a = False
b = False
c = True
d = False
e = False
f = True

5.
== (equal to)
> (greater than)
< (less than)
>= (greater than or equal to)
<= (less than or equal to)
!= (not equal to)

6.

Equality is denoted by double quality sign (==), whilst assignment is denoted by a single equality sign (=)

'A is equal to B' can be written as 'A == B'
Assigning A to B can be written as 'A=B'

7.
the first 'if' block::

if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')

----------------------------------------

second if block::

if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')

---------------------------------------

the else block::

else:
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')


8.
if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')

elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy)

else:
    print('Greetings!')

9.
Ctrl + c

10.
Break statment is used to stop the entire loop, whilst continue statment is used to stop the current iteration of the loop and skip to the next iteration

11.
All three statements are equivalent since the default start point and step size are 0 and 1. 
The second statement explicitly defines the start point as 0 and the third statement goes further to specify the step size.

12.
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i+=1

13.
spam.bacon()
